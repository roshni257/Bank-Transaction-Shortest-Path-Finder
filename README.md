## Bank Transaction Shortest Path Finder

# 1. Overview

This project is a graphical simulation of a bank transaction network that finds the shortest transaction path between two banks using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The application is built with Pygame and provides an interactive way to select source and destination banks to visualize the shortest path.

# 2. Features

- Dynamic Window Resizing: The layout adjusts when the window size changes.

- Graphical Representation: Nodes represent banks, and edges indicate transaction costs.

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Calculates the shortest transaction path between banks.

- Interactive Selection: Click on banks to set the source and destination.

- Reset Functionality: Reset the selection to try different paths.

# 3. Technologies Used

- Python

- Pygame

- Dijkstra's Algorithm

# 4. Graph Representation

- Nodes represent banks.

- Edges represent transaction paths with associated costs.

- The shortest path is highlighted in green.
